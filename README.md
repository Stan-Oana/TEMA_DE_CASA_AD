# TEMA_DE_CASA_AD

Prerequisities : 

Assuming that you have windows as your main OS, you have to accomplish some basic things before :
•	Install C on your computer(assuming that you want to run your code from CMD) :
Tutorial : 
  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
OR :
          Install  CodeBlocks Editor on your computer (if you want to run it into an integrated environment) : 
              Code Blocks download latest version (fosshub.com) : 
                 https://www.fosshub.com/Code-Blocks.html?dwl=codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe

To run in CMD : 
First, be sure that you are into the root directory of the application :
Use “cd” command to enter the root directory (for me it’s TEMA_DE_CASA_AD, assuming that you know already where is the root folder, you have to link also the general destination first… For example: if you have the root directory into Downloads, you will use cd to enter into Downloads folder):

     cd TEMA_DE_CASA_AD

Then run : 

    gcc main.c -o main.exe

Into CodeBlocks you will open the “.cbp” file from the root folder which is associated with CodeBlocks Project .

***The code is working fine, is printing the generated random data into “homari_in.txt” and the computed results into “homari_out.txt”
